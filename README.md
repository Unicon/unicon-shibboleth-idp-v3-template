Shibboleth IdP Installer Template
==============================

A template for installing the [Shibboleth Identity Provider v3.0](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/Installation) which makes available the [Shib-CAS-Authenticator plugin][shibcas] for external SSO authentication. The shibboleth installer is preconfigured and decorated with additional tasks that would provide a fully functional identity provider ready for deployment. 

# Features
- A more automated method of installing the Shibboleth Identity Provider.
- CAS `LoginHandler` to delegate to a CAS server for external authentication.
- Built-in configuration support for InCommon metadata.
- Built-in configuration support for TestShib metadata
- ~~Idp session lifetime is changed from the default 30 minutes to [1 minute](https://github.com/Unicon/unicon-shibboleth-idp-template/blob/master/installer/2.4.3/src/installer/resources/conf-tmpl/internal.xml#L102)~~ (This can be easily changed in the `idp.properties`).
- ~~Previous session handler is turned off~~ (haven't found it yet)
- Logging levels are changed to be at `DEBUG` by default
- ~~Externalized configuration for attribute resolution, login handlers, etc.~~ (Many of these properties are consolidated in the `idp.properties` by default)

# Versions

```properties
shibCasAuthenticatorVersion=3.0.0
shibIdpVersion=3.0.0
casClientVersion=3.3.3
```

# Requirements
- Ensure you have set `$CATALINA_HOME` or `$JETTY_HOME`.
- Ensure you have set `$JAVA_HOME` and `$JAVA_HOME\bin` is in your `$PATH`
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to execute the build and deploy artifacts to `$CATALINA_HOME` or `$JETTY_HOME`
- Ensure `$CATALINA_HOME` OR `$JETTY_HOME` is running under port 443 and valid certificates are installed.

# Configuration

## Installer Settings
The build is controlled by the [`install.properties`](https://github.com/Unicon/unicon-shibboleth-idp-template/blob/master/installer/2.4.3/src/installer/resources/install.properties) file. 

## Shib-CAS Authenticator Settings
The [Shib-CAS authenticator's configuration][shibcas] is controlled by an external properties file whose location is referenced via the `install.properties` file.

The  [Shib-CAS-Authenticator plugin][shibcas] may require additional tweaks to the server environment. Additional details are [posted here][shibcas]. This build does not modify the server environment's configuration at all. The adopter is responsible for making any and all changes needed to the deployment environment's configuration. (i.e. Tomcat's `server.xml`, etc)

# Build
Navigate to the `installer\3.0.0\bin` directory:

* To install the IdP and create the `idp.war` file, execute: `install`
* To install the IdP web fragment, execute: `install fragment`
* If you wish to combine all above tasks into one, simply execute: `install all`
* To see a list of targets available, execute: `install -projecthelp`

The installer will ask you a series of questions and will subsequently remember your answers by updating the `install.properties` file. It is recommended that you stick with the default answers given during the install, and only just provide environment specific answers (such as the idp host name, etc) 

Once the installation step is done, navigate to the `conf` directory of your `$IDP_HOME` and update the `cas-shib.properties` file with the addresses of your CAS and Shibboleth server. 

# Testing
* The build is configured to use the test SP service in its metadata. You should be able to test the functionality by [registering your Identity Provider metadata](https://www.testshib.org/metadata.html) with the test SP service. 
* The build is also configured to optionally use a set of trusted partners whose metadata is provided by the configuration file `metadata/TrustedPartners-metadata.xml`
* The build is also configured to accept the [InCommon metadata](https://github.com/Unicon/unicon-shibboleth-idp-template/blob/master/installer/2.4.3/src/installer/resources/conf-tmpl/relying-party.xml#L109). The metadata is expected to be signed and validated by the [metadata siging certificate](https://github.com/Unicon/unicon-shibboleth-idp-template/blob/master/installer/etc/inc-md-cert.pem) file.
